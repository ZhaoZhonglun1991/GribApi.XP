## GribApi.XP

GribApi.XP is a friendly fork of the ECMWF's [GRIB API](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/What+is+GRIB-API). It makes a few changes to improve cross-platform (hence the `XP`) parity of features and packages. At the moment, that mostly means improving support for Windows, but changes for all platforms are welcome.

### GRIB Tools Packages

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

To install the GRIB tools from [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/grib-tools), run
```shell
C:\> choco install grib-tools
```

##### Changes from Vanilla 1.14.5 for Windows
* PNG compression support
* Pre-built `definitions` and `samples`
* Thread safety for Windows via OpenMP
* `grib_exit` and `grib_assert` hooks for custom handling of fatal errors (details coming soon)

##### Building
You can build directly with Visual Studio using `./build/Grib.Api.Master.sln`.

To build x86 and x64 libs together, you can run `build/build_gribapi.cmd [re|build] [vs tools version] [Debug|Release] [opt: package version]`, e.g.
```shell
C:\> build/build_gribapi.cmd rebuild 12 Debug
```
